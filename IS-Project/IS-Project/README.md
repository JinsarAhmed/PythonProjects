<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This Project is all about Steganography combined with AES encryption. Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can use the scirpt for encoding/decoding secret messages inside images with a use of a secret key.

### Prerequisites

These are the things you need to perform in order to use it.  
Install :
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
* [Python pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

### Cloning

1. Open terminal
2. Go to your desired directory
3. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dsccvrgu/StegApp.git
   ```
3. Get into the directory
   ```sh
   cd StegApp
   ```
4. Install the requirements
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
  
### Run
```sh
  python3 app.py
```

## Reporting Issues

If you think you've found a bug, or something isn't behaving the way you think it should, please raise an  [issue](https://github.com/dsccvrgu/StegApp/issues)  on GitHub.

## Links
